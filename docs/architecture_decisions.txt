The recommendation is to split the monolithic app into 3 modules:

1. Persons module
The persons module includes the endpoints and service to get and post Persons. This is the service with the least used data.
As the business requirement is to save costs and there already exist REST endpoints for:
/persons GET
/persons POST
/persons/{person_id} GET
these endpoints should stay REST endpoints, but be separate in their own microservice.

2. Connections module
Technically part of the persons endpoints, this single request is much more computational intensive as well as much more requests are expected to happen.
This is because much location data needs to be processed to get the nearest persons for a given query (person, date, proximity).
The design is to use REST, to stay consistent with the persons API, but to use a KAFKA queue in addition.
With the KAFKA queue the risk of to many/computational request on this endpoint should be avoided. 
Requests are processed in order with the available computational power.
It includes the endpoint:
/persons/{person_id}/connections GET

3. Locations module
This is the module where the most heavy traffic is expected and includes all endpoints on the /api/locations path.
As the absolute need here is to strive for performance and scalability the choice is to use gRPC (sacrificing flexibility of REST).
In addition, a KAFKA queue is used to provide even better scalability, too.
